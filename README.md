# Three_Card_Pickup_Poker
This was part of a final project for my Artificial Intelligence class where we 
had to create four agents: two had to be created using techniques that we learned in 
class, and the last two had to be create using basic heuristics. We were given the 
option of working in a group or individually so I decided to work with a partner for
the project. I created four of the agents and my partner shared some input in the
design of the agents that we created. 

## Authors
The main authors of the base code that was given to us to simulate the poker game
was originally created by the graduate students of the professor of the Artificial
Intelligence class and the other author that the graduate students used for the 
implementation of the project. The names of the authors can be found in the files 
that they made and gave us and also our names in the files that we made for the
project. 
The files that we created include:
  - BlackStar.java
  - TsubakiNakatsukasa.java
  - RukiaKuchiki.java
  - ShunsuiKyoraku.java
  
The rest of the files are the files that were originally given to us as part
of the project. 
The graduate student authors of the other main files include:
  - Marcus Gutierezz
  - Oscar Veliz
  - Porag Chowdhury
  - Anjon Basak
  
The author the graduate students' used in implementing some of the other classes
  - Dan Puperi
